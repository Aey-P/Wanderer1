        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Bangkok (Hua Lamphong) railway station , RTGS: Sathani Krung Thep (Hua Lamphong)) is a railway station in Pathum Wan, 
            the former central passenger terminal in Bangkok and the former railway hub of Thailand. (Wikipedia)</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Personally, Hua Lamphong gives off such a nostalgic vibe that I miss from my daily life. The food, handicrafts, culture, 
            and traditional lifestyle that have existed for over a century, everything about it just feels warm and inviting. 
            If you‚Äôre looking to spend a 'wander'ful day soaking in some art and sipping on a delicious cup of coffee, this might be your perfect place.</p>

                Feeling the classic vibe with all those traditional trains still running, 
                taking folks out to the suburbs. And if you are still interested in Thai train history.

                it's totally worth to witness the stunning architecture of the early post-absolute monarchy Thai Buddhist temple
